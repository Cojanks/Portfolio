# Timeline Component

A list-based timeline component which visually desctibes an order of events. Events have an optional ability to add additional information & contain a multiple events within.

## Product design & thinking for this component

I wanted a visually striking way to organinze an order of events (in this case, my work history) with an ability to add details to the events.

Since a component like this could have multiple uses (shipping history, for example), I wanted the data for this component to come via JSON to simulate data coming from some other kind of micro-service.

### Future features:

- I would have loved to have the ability for a user to place their own JSX into the component as a child and key it to particular event.
- Theming ability

### Opportunities for improvement:

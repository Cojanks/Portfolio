# Tab Component

A multi-view component to organize & view data based on which tab is active or user interaction.
The tab content (pane) can be custom JSX, allowing for different, custom views of content

## Product design & thinking for this component

- All tab content can be JSX, giving the developer a lot of flexability in how they would like to displaay their content. (In this case, I went with individual view components that contained the Timeline component in one case and a custome list in another)
- Initial active tab is provided to the component or defaaults to index 0 of the panes array

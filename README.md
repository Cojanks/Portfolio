# A Treatise in Front End Engineering Portfolios. (The Corey Jenkins Story)

Welcome!
(Okay, you were expecting a unique opening hook here so let me try again...)

'The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel...'

(Mr. Gibson, please don't sue me)

## Why you are here

Finding the right front end developer for your company or project can be a difficult process. I have been on both sides of that journey and I can full empathize with your current task. In an effort to ease your decision, I have decided to build you this:

A [Portfolio & body of work](https://cojanks.github.io/portfolio/) that gives you the examples and tools to confirm that I am the right candidate for your `engineering team` or `React-based project`.

## (Ok, now for the self promotion)

Your time is valuable so why don't I summarize why you should invite me to join your team or project.

- I am a `designer by education` with an `engineer's methodology and skillset`, combining the best of both worlds to create intuitive, scalable, and beautiful experiences for your users and customers.
- A `width breadth` of experience. From large Fintech companies, startups engineering teams of less than 15 employees, to one-off web projects, I have installed myself as an intregral part of any team.
- `Client-facing` collaboration & communication expertise. We engineers love to build things and building lasting relationships with clients is something I enjoy.
- I `enjoy building unique interactions`. You have a distinctive product which you believe stands out in this market and I would love to help you make it stand out even more. Let's work together!

## For you delightful technical & hiring managers

You are here looking for a skilled React developer and your engineering loops will likely test proficiencies with features like `React Hooks`, `Redux/RTK`, `Validation`, `State Management`, `Componentization`, and a myriad other skills.

`I built this portfolio specifically for you.`

1. Head to my [portfolio site](https://cojanks.github.io/portfolio/)
2. (Coming soon, still building these features) Find the section where you can filter projects, widgets, or small components by those same skillsets (listed above and many more, besides) that you are looking for!
3. Review the many README's for these projects or components where you can view my design thinking, product decision-making process, and opportunities where I would have improved or where/how I would have added new features.
4. Check out the many custom components that I built for this site and try to find all the hidden easter eggs and treasures scattered around the page and code. Who said making things, even self promotion work can't be fun?
5. Drink some water, if you haven't already today.

## Product design & thinking for this site

I will be including a section like this in the README's for many of the components in this repo so you can see my thought process and why I built my components like I did.

(Coming soon, still building these)
